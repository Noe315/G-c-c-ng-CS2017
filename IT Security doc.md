<h1> IT Security </h1>

*Here are the list of information that need to be composed* 

# Lec1
## Introduction



   * **What is the term of security?**
           * Protection of information and information systems against `unauthorized access` and `modification` and `availability` of information system services for `legitimate users`, including measures to thwart, discover or log threats. Protection against unauthorized access must be ensured during `storage`,` processing` or `in transit`
* **What is the aim of security? Example**
    * Confidentiality: Against unauthorized access
    * Integrity: Against unauthorized modification
    * Availability: Resources and services are available for legit users
    * Non-repudiation: Ability to prove that a given message was sent and by whom to a third party not involved in communication.
    * Authenticity and authentication:  Explicit identification of the sender of info or a communication peer
    * Authorization: limit access to certain (group) of users.
* **What are passive and active attack?Why those need to be distinct**
     * Passive
          * Attacker doesn't actively participate
          * Difficult to discover
          * Preventive means of protection against active attacks (?)
     * Active
          * Attacker actively participate
          * Manipulate data or systems
          * Attacker often leaves traces
          * Prevention and Detection is possible
     * Why distinct these 2 type of attack? **not sure**
          * Because each of these attack focus on different basis, perform diff task, cause different type of damage and and focus on different IT-Security aim. => need to differentiate to have suitable method to prevent those attack
* **Explain security processes and its phases** (not sure)
     * Plan: Establish `objectives and processes` required to deliver the `desired results`.
     * Do: 
       * The do phase allows the `plan` from the previous step `to be done`. 
       * `Small changes` are usually `tested`, and 
       * data is gathered to see `how effective` the change is.
     * Check: During the check phase, 
       * the `data and results` gathered from the do phase are `evaluated`. Data are `compared to the expected outcomes` to see any  similarities and differences.
       *  The testing process is also evaluated to see `if there were any changes from the original` test created during the planning phase. To see `what changes work better` than others, and if said changes  can be `improved` as well.
     * Act: 
       * This act phase is where a `process is improved`.  
       * Records from the "do" and "check" phases help `identify issues` with the  process. (These issues may include problems, non-conformities,  opportunities for improvement, inefficiencies and other issues that result in outcomes that are evidently less-than-optimal). 
       * Root `causes of  such issues are investigated`, `found and eliminated` by modifying the  process. Risk is `re-evaluated`. 
       * At the end of the actions in this phase,  the `process has better instructions, standards or goals`. `Planning for  the next cycle` can proceed with a `better base-line`. Work in the `next do phase` should `not create recurrence` of the identified issues; if it does, then the action was not effective.
* **Difference between nonrepudiation and authenticity**
  * Authentication verifies who you are (User-ID) while Non-Repudiation verifies what you did (e.g Sending a message).
  * Authenticity is about one party (say, Alice) interacting with another (Bob) to convince Bob that some data really comes from Alice.
  * Non-repudiation is about Alice showing to Bob a proof that some data really comes from Alice, such that not only Bob is convinced, but Bob also gets the assurance that he could show the same proof to Charlie, and Charlie would be convinced, too, even if Charlie does not trust Bob.

## Cryptography

   * **Model of a cryptographic system**
     
       * slide
      * ![image-20200403150608571](img/image-20200403150608571.png)
* **Classical encryption methods?**
   * Substitution
   * Transposition
   * Product cipher
   * Applying multiple substitutions and/or transpositions possible  
* **Differences between public key and symmetric encryption schemes and their respective adv and disadvantage**
   * Symmetric encryption schemes: key is identical for both sender and receiver 
      * Advantage: 
        * Faster
        * Because the key is not transmitted with the data, so if the connection is intercepted, the data is safe
        * Only the system which possesses the secret key can decrypt a message
      * Disadvantage:
        * The secret key must be exchange before the message, and if the attacker can intercept the connection, then any message using that key to encrypt can be decrypted
        * Cannot provide digital signatures that cannot be repudiated
   * Public key: different pair of key for every direction of communication
      * Advantage:
        * There is no need to exchange the private key (which help the recipient to read the encrypted message) so if the connection is intercepted, the message is still safe
        * Can provide digital signatures that cannot be repudiated 
      * Disadvantage:
        * Slower
* **Term of Hybrid encryption scheme and its sequence thereof**
  
   * It's like the mix of symmetric and public key schemes: Hybrid encryption is achieved through data transfer using unique session keys along with symmetrical encryption. Public key encryption is implemented for random symmetric key encryption. The recipient then uses the public key encryption method to decrypt the symmetric key. Once the symmetric key is recovered, it is then used to decrypt the message.
* **Term of "Mode of operation". Outline encrypt and decrypt for at least 2 different modes**
   * Mode of operation is  an algorithm used in conjunction with a block cipher that makes up the complete encryption algorithm
   * Used in CBC, CFM
* **Conditions must be met to conduct brute force attack**
  
  * Length of cipher must longer than key's cipher and key must be finite number of bit
* **What is One time pad? and why it is unbreakable if the encryption key is unknow**
  
  * Use randomness to generate key, and encrypt the message with that random key, so it is uniform distribution
* **How Electronic Code Book (ECB) work. Its adv and disadvantage? When this method can be use **
   * How it works: The user take the first block of plaintext and encrypts it with the key to produce the first block of ciphertext. Then takes the the second block and do the same process and so on
   * ![](img/ecb.PNG)
   * Advantage: Simple to implement, and can be processed in parallel.
   * Disadvantage: Blocks of plaintext go through the same encrypt processes, so the attacker might guess the plaintext if 1 plaintext is sent over and over again. The attacker can also mess up the block order => make the message incorrect
* **How Cipher Block Chaining,Cipher Feedback Mode, Output Feedback Mode, Counter Mode work? **
   * CBC: ![](img/cbc.PNG)
   
   * CFB:![](img/cfb.PNG)

## Authentication

* **Term of "Authentication" and "Authencity". Factors for it? What is two-factor-authentication**
    	* Authencity: The quality of being genuine or not corrupted from the original. 
    * Authentication: something which validates or confirms the authenticity of something 
    * What you know (Password), What you have (Token), What you are (Biometry)
    * 2-Factor-authentication: provide multiple proof of your identification to get the permission to access.
* **Name and explain on which points the security of password-based authentication schemes depends.**

     * Size of password domain, choice of password and password policies
     * Security of strong passwords
     * Security when entering/transmitting passwords.
* **How secure password should be chosen?(Not sure)**
     * Long password, special character, capital letter, numbers, don't use natural language
* **Describe the sequence in a password-based challenge-response authentication and compare its security with sending the password directly either encrypted or unencrypted.**
* Sequence:![](img/password-based.PNG)
     * Compare: Challenge-response authentication can defend against [session replay attacks](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/session-replay-script), in which an attacker listens to previous messages and resends them  later to get the same credentials as the original message.  Challenge-response systems defend against replay attacks, because each  challenge and response is unique. An attacker monitoring credentials  exchanges and then attempting to reuse credentials will not succeed in  gaining access.
* **Describe the terms Token, Smart Card and Biometry and explain their use for authentication**
     * Token: a device that show digits that are changed every minute, can be calculated on the token with some cryptographic embedded in the token which is not ez to extracted
     * Smart card: card that is auth by prove themselves to the card reader that they are really presented by means of cryptography
     * Biometry: physical properties of a person. To prove that you are really you.
* **Describe Cryptographic Hash Functions**
  
  * Compute characteristic pattern (“fingerprint”) of fixed length for each message. Mostly 128 or 256 bits. It should be impossible to find a message producing a given hash value, to find two messages with the same hash value. Widely used algorithms: MD5 and SHA
* **Describe how public key or symmetric cryptography can be used for authentication.**

     * Symmetric key: 
     * ![image-20200424211818767](img/image-20200424211818767.png)
     * Public key: ![image-20200424211900083](img/image-20200424211900083.png)
* **Describe what a digital signature is and how it operates. Also describe how hash functions are used in digital signatures.**

     * A process that guarantees that the contents of a message haven't been altered in transit. Sender signs message with private key. Public key is used for validation
     * Hash function: transforming data of any size into a fixed size. Hash function will  generate unique digital fingerprint. Alice writes a message to Bob, A will hash the message, and then combines the hash value with her private key to generate a digital signature.
* **Explain in detail format, composition and use of certificates. Also describe Certificate Authorities, Root-CA and Certificate revocation.**

     * Format: Bundle of Information of the owner of public key, along with public key, signature of certificate authority (also info about CA).
     * Certificate authority: take the certificate request which consist of  info of the entity (user, web server, ...) along with it's public key, and then it check that this public key is truly belong to that entity. Then CA will sign this certificate with it's private key (compute the hash, then encrypt the hash with private key)
     * Certificate: say B, might not know A but B know its CA and B already had the public key of that CA, so B can check that whether the signature is ok or not. So if B trust this CA, then B can know the public key of A.
     * Root-CA: CA sign its own certificate
     * Certificate revocation: certificate that is no longer valid because that have been withdrawn
* **Discuss advantages and disadvantages of using cerfiticates and CAs.**
     * Advantage: Certificate is public, so anyone can have.
     * Disadvantage: 
       * Trustworthy only given if the root CA and other CA involved in the process are trustworthy
       * CA is compromised and still issuing certificate which might not belong to valid institution
       * Revocation is problematic because sometime this is not checked.

# Network Applications (this lecture dont have file exercise)



* **POP-Auth?**
  * when you fetch a email, you will tell the server your username, the user keyword and the server will rep with the ok. then you will send out the pass phrase (secret) then the server will rep with another ok again, then you are logged in
* **How emails work?**
  * Sender first contact the sender's mail server by a protocol called smtp, then the sender's mail send to recipient's mail server also using smtp protocol, and the mail will be stored in this server. when the recipient want to read the email, the recipient will contact that mail server to get the mail by a protocol called POP/IMAP
* **App layer encryption**
  * before send out the email, convert it to ciphertext and then proceed the normal email sending procedure. When the email is arrived at the final destination and the other end, the email will then be decrypted
* **SSH**
  * The SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another
  * The protocol works in the client-server model, which means that the  connection is established by the SSH client connecting to the SSH  server. The SSH client drives the connection setup process and uses  public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server. After  the setup phase the SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption and  hashing algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data that  is exchanged between the client and server.
  * ![](img/How_does_the_SSH_protocol_work_.png)
* **Local PFW**
  * connection that transfer from SSH Client to SSH Server to the destination host/server 
  * ![](img/loca_pfw.gif)
* **Remote PFW**
  * connection that transfer from SSH Server to SSH Client to the destination host/server 
  * ![](img/remote_pfw.gif)
* **TLS/SSL**
  * [cryptographic protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol) designed to provide [communications security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_security) over a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network).
  * Structure: ![](img/tls_ssl_structure.PNG)
  * Lay between Application layer and Transport layer
  * Consist of 2 smaller layer in TLS/SSL protocol: 
    * First 3 protocol for negotiate of the encrypted connection, 4th one for transferring something.
    * TLS Record Protocol: transferring record which are encrypted symmetrical cryptographical mechanism and using digital signature for ensuring integrity of respective record. Then this protocol will be then used by other specified protocol for transmission 
  * How TLS/SSL is used: handshake protocol.
* **Dynamic content**
  * Content that constantly or regularly changes based on user interactions, timing and other parameters that determine what content is delivered to the user (like Facebook)
* **Simple Anonymization**
* **S/MIME**
  *  A standard for [public key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key) [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) and [signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) of [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME) ( **MIME** is an [Internet standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_standard) that extends the format of [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) messages to support text in [character sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_set) other than [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application  programs.  Message bodies may consist of multiple parts, and header  information may be specified in non-ASCII character sets. Email messages with MIME formatting are typically transmitted with standard protocols, such as the  [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) (SMTP), the [Post Office Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol) (POP), and the [Internet Message Access Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol) (IMAP).) data
  * S/MIME provides the following cryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications:
    - [Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication)
    - Message integrity
    - [Non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) of origin (using digital signatures)
    - Privacy
    - Data security (using encryption)
* **PGP**
  * **Pretty Good Privacy** (**PGP**) is an [encryption program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software) that provides [cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic) [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) and [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) for [data communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communication). PGP is used for [signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature), encrypting, and decrypting texts, [e-mails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email), files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications
